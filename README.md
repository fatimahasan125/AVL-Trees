# AVL-Trees
Implementation of AVL Trees in C++

## How to run 
Create a new console application project in Visual Studio and add the header and source files provided. The input.txt can be used to load data into the AVL tree. Other than that, we can insert, delete, look up and print the AVL Tree. 

AVL Trees have the benefit of being balanced so they provide all operations in O(logn).
